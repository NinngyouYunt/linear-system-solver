# linear-system-solver

This is the Java program that I am doing right now for IDC4UM calculus course. 
The purpose of the program is to input a system of linear equation and give out the solutions whether it is unique, a parametric solution or there is no solution.
I know the Matlab would do the work much better and faster, but I do find it a really interesting project to make. 
Feel free to download the repository and check it out although it is still incomplete.
